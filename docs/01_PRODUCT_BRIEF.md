# Product Brief

## Product

Pulse: a mobile-first "link in bio" minisite builder.

## Primary User

Creators and small businesses that need one public page aggregating links, media, and highlights.

## Core Value

Turn a social bio into a conversion-oriented minisite quickly.

## Must-Have Capabilities

- Authentication (email/password and Google OAuth)
- One editable public page per user
- Block-based editor (add/edit/reorder/toggle/delete blocks)
- Public page rendering with publish/unpublish
- Basic analytics (views/clicks)
- Theme customization

## Business Constraints

- Free tier first; premium features can be gated without full payment integration.
- Keep deployment simple (already deployed on Vercel).
- Favor low maintenance and clear UX over complex architecture.

## Current Strategic Priority

1. Reliability of existing flows
2. Editor quality and polish
3. Analytics correctness
4. Premium/payment foundation
