### Session 2026-02-18

- Actor: Codex
- Objective: Create an AI-operable documentation system for handoff continuity
- Backlog Item: N/A (project operations setup)
- Changes:
  - `README.md`: replaced boilerplate with repository-specific onboarding
  - `docs/README.md`: added docs hub and source-of-truth guidance
  - `docs/00_AGENT_START_HERE.md`: added mandatory session workflow and DoD
  - `docs/01_PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`: added concise product direction
  - `docs/02_CURRENT_STATE.md`: added implementation truth snapshot
  - `docs/03_BACKLOG.md`: added prioritized backlog with status model
  - `docs/05_RUNBOOK.md`: added run/test/deploy troubleshooting runbook
- Validation:
  - Manual: reviewed structure coherence and path references
- Risks:
  - Existing legacy docs may still diverge from code over time if not maintained
- Next:
  - Execute `P0-1` (API validation with zod)

### Session 2026-02-18 20:57 -03 (local)

- Actor: Codex
- Objective: Complete `P0-1` by adding request validation to auth/page/block/analytics APIs
- Backlog Item: P0-1
- Changes:
  - `src/lib/api/validation.ts`: added shared `zod` validation helpers for body/params/query parsing
  - `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`: added schema-based request body validation
  - `src/app/api/user/route.ts`: added schema validation for PATCH payload and cleanup for DELETE signature
  - `src/app/api/pages/route.ts`: added schema validation for page creation payload
  - `src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/route.ts`: added params + PATCH payload validation
  - `src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/blocks/route.ts`: added params + create/reorder payload validation
  - `src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/blocks/[blockId]/route.ts`: added params + update payload validation
  - `src/app/api/analytics/route.ts`: validated `days` query param with range limits
  - `src/app/api/analytics/click/route.ts`: validated click tracking payload
  - `docs/03_BACKLOG.md`: set `P0-1` to `DONE`
  - `docs/02_CURRENT_STATE.md`: documented shared request validation as implemented
  - `docs/06_OPENCLAW_SETUP.md`: added OpenClaw requirements/permissions/checklists for private repo operations
  - `docs/README.md`: linked new OpenClaw setup document
- Validation:
  - Command: `npx eslint src/lib/api/validation.ts src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts src/app/api/user/route.ts src/app/api/pages/route.ts 'src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/route.ts' 'src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/blocks/route.ts' 'src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/blocks/[blockId]/route.ts' src/app/api/analytics/route.ts src/app/api/analytics/click/route.ts` -> passed
  - Command: `npm run lint` -> failed due pre-existing unrelated repo lint errors outside touched files
  - Command: `npm run build` -> failed in sandbox due blocked network fetch for Google Fonts (`Geist`)
- Risks:
  - `theme`/`content` JSON fields are validated as generic objects (shape is intentionally permissive for now)
  - Full repository lint/build remains red due pre-existing issues not part of `P0-1`
- Next:
  - Execute `P0-2` (centralized API error response helper)

### Session 2026-02-19 00:00 UTC (local)

- Actor: OpenClaw+Codex
- Objective: Restore lint/build reliability so deploys to Vercel don't fail on main
- Backlog Item: P0-1.1
- Changes:
  - `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/editor/editor-content.tsx`: removed `any` usage, aligned local `Block` type with `BlockType`, removed unused `userId` prop
  - `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/editor/page.tsx`: fixed lint issues (unused import, `const` usage), updated prop passing
  - `src/components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`: refactored inline component creation into stable JSX node to satisfy react-hooks static component lint rule
  - `src/components/providers/theme-provider.tsx`: removed setState-in-effect anti-pattern by lazy-loading theme from localStorage
  - `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/settings-content.tsx`: fixed unescaped apostrophe lint error
  - `src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/blocks/[blockId]/route.ts`: fixed Prisma JSON typing for `content` updates
  - `src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/blocks/route.ts`: fixed Prisma JSON typing for `content` on create
  - `src/app/api/pages/[pageId]/route.ts`: fixed Prisma JSON typing for `theme` updates
  - `docs/02_CURRENT_STATE.md`: updated implementation snapshot and build reliability status
  - `docs/03_BACKLOG.md`: marked `P0-1.1` as `DONE`
- Validation:
  - Command: `npm run lint` -> passed with warnings only (0 errors)
  - Command: `npm run build` -> passed successfully
  - Manual: reviewed changed API update/create paths and dashboard editor/sidebar/theme-provider render paths
- Risks:
  - Lint warnings remain (unused vars + `<img>` warnings), but they are non-blocking for build/deploy
- Next:
  - Execute `P0-2` (centralized API error shape/helper)
