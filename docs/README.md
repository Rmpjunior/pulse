# Pulse Documentation Hub

This folder has two documentation layers:

1. `Operational docs` for day-to-day execution by AI agents and humans.
2. `Reference docs` for architecture/features/API/database details.

## Operational Docs (Primary)

- `docs/00_AGENT_START_HERE.md`: Mandatory workflow for each coding session
- `docs/01_PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`: Product goals, users, and constraints
- `docs/02_CURRENT_STATE.md`: What is implemented today vs missing
- `docs/03_BACKLOG.md`: Prioritized work queue
- `docs/04_SESSION_LOG.md`: Session-by-session changelog template
- `docs/05_RUNBOOK.md`: Run, test, deploy, and troubleshoot instructions
- `docs/06_OPENCLAW_SETUP.md`: Requirements and permissions for OpenClaw sessions

## Reference Docs (Secondary)

- `docs/FEATURES.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/API.md`

Use operational docs first to avoid context drift.
